    Synchronise Movies / TVShows with Trakt (more infos and account creation: http://trakt.tv/).
    This plugin isn't a replacement for the official trakt plugin. It's a supplement to the trakt plugin.
    
    This is an open-source project.
    I'll do my best, but the use is at own risk.
    
    Utilities:
        - Update Movie Collection:
            updates your trakt movie library (not the seen movies) with your xbmc collection
        
        - Sync seen Movies:
            synchronise seen movies between xbmc and trakt
            seen movies from xbmc will be set as seen on trakt
            seen movies from trakt will be set as seen on xbmc
            it don't sets movies as unseen
        
        - Update TV Show Collection:
            same like Update Movie Collection, but for TV Shows.
            
        - Sync seen TV Shows:
            same like Sync seen Movies, but for TV Shows.
            
        - Clean Movie Collection:
            this will remove deleted movies from the trakt collection (unlibrary, it will not set movies as unseen).
            ATTENTION:
            don't use this function, if you collect data about your DVDs, Blu-Rays, etc.
            this will unlibrary all movies, that are not listed in xbmc
            
        - Clean TV Show Collection:
            same like Clean Movie Collection, but for TV Shows
    
    The Utilities for TV Shows only work yet, if your scraper is TVDB (http://thetvdb.com/).
    
    Special Thanks to: Justin Nemeth and Sean Rudford, for the great Trakt project.
